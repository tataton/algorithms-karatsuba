        <p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karatsuba_algorithm">Karatsuba Multiplication Algorithm</a> is a recursive method for multiplying two integers. The algorithm reduces the total number of computational steps, especially for multiplying large numbers, relative to the standard single-digit multiplication method that we all learn in grade school.</p>
        <p>This page compares my Karatsuba algorithm output with output from <a href="https://github.com/MikeMcl/big.js/">big.js</a>, a JavaScript library designed for precision arithmetic on large numbers. I can't use direct multiplication in JavaScript to test, because native JavaScript has an upper limit to integers of 2<sup>53</sup>, or 9007199254740991. No JavaScript math can use a number higher than this as an input, or result in a number higher than this as a product, without introducing error. In my code, I deal with this by handling all values other than single digits as arrays of digits. I am actually not sure how big.js deals with it, but I only use big.js to test; it is not used in my Karatsuba method code. I think this type of problem would normally be tested in a language like Python, which has no limit on integer size. But I don't know how to handle web output for any other language yet, so I&#39;m using JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Executing the method (by pressing "Submit" below) may result in a call stack overflow if the numbers are too large. I recommend keeping your numbers less than 32 digits (and certainly less than 64).</p>
